## Local Development

To develop the plug in local environment along with care, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the care root directory and clone the plugin repository:

```bash
cd care
git clone git@github.com:ohcnetwork/care_camera_asset.git
```

2. Add the plugin config in plug_config.py

```python
...

hello_plugin = Plug(
    name="camera", # name of the django app in the plugin
    package_name="/app/care_camera_asset", # this has to be /app/ + plugin folder name
    version="", # keep it empty for local development
    configs={}, # plugin configurations if any
)
plugs = [hello_plug]

...
```

3. Tweak the code in plugs/manager.py, install the plugin in editable mode

```python
...

subprocess.check_call(
    [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-e", *packages] # add -e flag to install in editable mode
)

...
```

4. Rebuild the docker image and run the server

```bash
make re-build
make up
```
